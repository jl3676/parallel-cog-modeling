# parallel-cog-model-fitting
Example codebase using parallelization to accelerate cognitive model fitting

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The `fit_models.ipynb` file contains example code for simulating data and fitting models using parallelization.

The `src` folder contains the source code for data processing, modeling, and plotting.

## MATLAB resources
See the [Dynamic Noise Estimation](https://github.com/jl3676/dynamic_noise_estimation) repository for examples of parallelizing model fitting in MATLAB.
